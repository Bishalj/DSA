Requiremnet : Design Twitter


1. Functional Requirement
    1. User profile
    2. Create a new Post
    3. View all post text/images
    4. Manage Followers
    5. Like and comment
    6. Search people / post, etc
    7. Share post.


2. Non Functional Requirement
    1. High Availability
    2. Scalable
    3. Telemetry

3. Bandwidth Estimation:
    - write-read ratio 1:10
    - Suppose we are getting 10 Million users daily and assuming 80% of the request coming in 10hr
    ~ 250 req/sec

    capacity estimations:
    - User details
    - Post details txt to image ratio if we assume 10:1
        - text : 10kb - 9GB/day (20TB)
        - images : 2mb - .2 TB/day (365TB)
        Total space - 385TB


4. System APIs
    Create a new post
    view all the post
    sha
