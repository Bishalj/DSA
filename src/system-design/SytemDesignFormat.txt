System Design interview

1. Functional Requirement


2.Non Functional Requirement
    - The system should be highly available.
    -

    Extended Requirement
    Analytics; e.g., how many times a redirection happened?
    Our service should also be accessible through REST APIs by other services.



3. Capacity Estimations
    i. Network Estimation
        - Read write ratios

    ii. Memory Estimation
        - DB Estimates
            - You can take ballpark estimates of bytes of 1 row. Suppose 500kb
            - Max storage required for 5 years
        - Cahce Estimates - Assuming 20% of ghe records will be cached

4. System APIs:
    - createURL(api_dev_key, original_url, custom_alias=None, user_name=None, expire_date=None)
    - deleteURL(api_dev_key, url_key)

5. Database Design


6. Basic System Design and Algorithm (Explaining the design)
